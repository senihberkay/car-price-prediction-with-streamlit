# Feature Extraction & Used Car Price Prediction Pipeline (for training on AutoScout data)

A Streamlit-based application to extract features and predict used car prices. In this application, I have developed a Pipeline to let anyone train their own multiple Machine Learning models on AutoScout data simultaneously to generate the best price using the best model.

<br>

## There are six filters to predict price in the web app

* Car Model
* Hp (Horse Power)
* Age
* Km 
* Gears
* Gears Type
